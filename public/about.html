<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Lihi Zin, I'm almost 28 years old. I live in Beer Sheva with my awosme boyfriend and I'm a CS student.</p>

<p>I really like to design, and I find it intersting to combine mt school knowledge with design by learning full stack.
  I'm currently working in a startup called Morphisec as an IT technician but definitly want to work as a full stack developer in the future.
